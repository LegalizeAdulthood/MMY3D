# MMY3D

This repository contains the source code for MMY3D, a 3D fractal movie maker by Yann Le Bihan.

The code is experimental and in a prototype state.

The binary can be downloaded from [Karl Runmo's site](http://www.chillheimer.de/kallesfraktaler/mmy/)
and there is a [tutorial](http://www.arpege-expertise.com/mmy3d/tutorial.html) as well.
